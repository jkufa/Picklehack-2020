1,1,melee  
2,1, Yeah  guess for  tekken characters the standard   bit different lmao  might just need more time  click with her but  feel like somethings missing along with  few weird hitboxes and stuff The entire katon stance esp the parry seems like  massive waste 
3,0, Either way because  many moves being borrowed  feels like she doesnt have her own identity really But its like almost there imo and she has  unique style visually thats why she feels unpolished 
4,1, Shes obv ment  have moves based  several characters but  feel like because   you either overwhelm your opponent with strings  gimmicks  you stick  very strict whiff punishblock punish gameplan which   feels like those two playstyles dont mesh that well 
5,1,  few hitbox issues    having one  the jabs missing after first one connecting  common Her  combo ender  wall randomly seems  have you teleport behind the opponent sometimes notOutside  that  feels like its just  shitton  moves with  clear gameplan tbh 
6,1,Kunimitsu  like the  far most visually polished character but her gameplay feels like  unpolished mess  times Shes still fun though playing her teaches you about how    absolute cheeselord online lmao 
7,1,Ive improved  capturing amp testing camera footage  heres  more accurate round  Tekken  testsOffline input delay  low graphics etc  which  fine For comparison   FOnline delays  addition  the  bars  bars wifi lol  bars  
8,0,LOOKS LIKE  MID   BRO   
9,1, its only  problem when someone who hasnt played tekken for many years says  dont  get  
10,1, Huh Its the gameplay content itself that gets  blockedAnd have you tried streaming  
11,0,  got  source  this like  monitor review  such 
12,1, Well   specific  melee Because Ive played many fps games with gsync  and  iirc and  believe ive done gsync  before  well for melee 
13,1, Huh Will def turn  off for  then 
14,1, Did graphics and anti aliasing really change input delay 
15,0,  Wait  bars literally increases    frames 
16,1,  Nvidia control panel 
17,1,  fixes screen tearing like vsync but almost lag lessYou can enable  overall then specifically disable  for dolphinexe 
18,1, Yuup Its apparently monitor dependent how much  matters prob more common with very high refresh rate monitors  
19,1,   monitor has  more  for  than  Tested  rtings 
20,0,  remind   gift you  sub next time 
21,1, basically means that  have been playing with  extra frames  delay for  while now LMAOThe way  fix mine was  turn off Gsync for melee others said they fixed theirs  changing the refresh rate   different monitor after opening melee  
22,1, the way everyone should check  make sure that their Melee  running    you have the monitor for itMine had  bug where  would   everywhere but fullscreen melee you can check   turning  your monitor display use the physical buttons   
23,1, have won Poilon Arena  attaining another World Championship   collection  trophies and further cementing   winrate  the GOAT Region not even losing  set Previous wins this year includes World Champion titles with Random and Sheik  wellGood games

27,0,  surprised  happened with amsah pip never heard  that before  wonder  its ISP  routing  the area  something since  connections with like america spain and france are still exactly how they used

29,0,  Yeah  think its isp throttling people sadly  well  hope  gets fixed soon 
30,1,  also   dropping out   forced  play someone with shitty german internet just letting you know lmao 
31,0,    ive dropped out   tournaments this year One because  got food poisoning and was  the toilet for  days straight with agonizing pain The other one for not being able  sleep due  election and taking  very old cat  the vetGoing back  valhalla  years agolol

33,1,  Its just banter really  just want people  actually play with  and stop playing unranked all day  stream for hours and  basically never say   someone good comes  and asksAs for online tournaments with  prizepool  could not care less tbh 
34,1,   not talking about you  the tweet since you showed  amp have played with  several times  taken  advice  wellI think positive reinforcement works for some but  very often ask for top players  play with day  and day out and very rarely  people show  
35,1, Main man has been one  the only ones  havent seen rage lately and even pretty often compliments his opponent  has called people  smurf tho again  agreed  itThe fuck how  this drama lmao just saying ranked  tilting Tekken stans smh

46,1,Tekkens netcode with its online  not THAT good but honestly its  many times better than dbfz  ultimates that  really makes  wish  liked the game itself  bit moreI cant fucking wait for the next generation  fighting games with actual great rollback 
47,1,Kunimitsu  fun Not sure  shes great but shes definitely not bad Like most tekken characters she has  crapton  moves and plenty  gimmicks Her movement and punish game  legit tho 
48,0, bad rollback but not  bad  SFVWorks well within regions but like cross coast   going  feel significantly worse but maybe  playable  some level 
49,1,LiveGoing   trying out Kunimitsu the new Tekken  character then going  experiment more with the netcode and try out the new Ranked system  
50,0,  try  out  offline  timed  rematch   second   first match  Ranked  about  seconds for rematch now btw 
51,1,the tekken netcode seems like  pretty decent improvement but its still far from  good proper rollback games Still  step above SFVs shitty implementation for sure 
52,0,This shows that its fixable however  lets please try  get   fix this 
53,1,They actually reduced rematching someone  ranked but not  lobbies First loadtime  someone  still  seconds then though and most people leave after  game   
54,1,Tekkens netcode might  better but god damn does its online still suck  
55,1,Today  Tekken  learnedYou can not play   CPU offlineYou can not set  password for  lobby you literally have  add them  your steam account  you want  private sessionJFC
