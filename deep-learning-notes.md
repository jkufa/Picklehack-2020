# Making a deep learning dataset
## Samples and Labels
Each dataset consists of samples and labels.
* Samples/Inputs: simply the underlying dataset. Each point in the dataset is a sample/input
* Labels/Targets: classification for each sample. Example: cat or dog.

## Types of Neural Networks
Here are some types of neural networks.
* Sequential model: 
  * X: Inputs. Data type can be things such as: 
    * numpy array
    * tensorflow tensor
  * Y: target data. data type much match X.
